Structure:
1. There are in total 5 classes we implement in this project, namely Window, 
Borad, Preview, State, Item. 
2. Window, Board, Preview and State are all QObjects while Item is used in 
State to help complete the algorithm of the game.
3. We separate the algorithm (in State and Item) from the UI. 

Window: This class is the main window of this project. We construct other objects 
        except for Item in this class as its private member. It also has 2 Qlabel 
        used to display score and level. 
        Its main functions include:
        (1) Build the connections between other objects.
        (2) Listen to keyPressEvent and send the signals.
        (3) Arrange and show all the widgets used in this game.
        
State: (1)This class contains the main algorithm of this project. It constructs 
          a pointer to items and uses its member function to judge and determain 
          the position of items to achieve the game.
       (2)To store the information of the game, it constructs a pointer to 2D 
          int array where integers from 0 to 7 represent different color
          (0 means no block at that point).

Item: This class is used to build a tetrix piece in state. Every piece has a
      2D int array and an int to represent its shape and colour.
        
        
Board and Preview: They're used to listen to the signals from state and update
                   themselves to display the game. 
                   Borad recieves a pointer to 2D integer array from state.
                   Preview recieves the shape number of the text tetrix piece.
